There's snakes in the garden
Blood on the vines
Every time I slip away
It feels like a crime
(Hush) Underneath the shadows, the acheing ground
The grey of the moon is all we have now
Soul for sale
(Hush)

(Hush) Soul for sale
Soul for sale
Soul for sale

There's ropes in the hallway
Scars in the silver
I know there will come a day
When red runs the river
Keep the light on, keep the light on, waiting
Keep the light on, keep the light on, praying
For you (all the silver linings that hide in the cover of night)

(Hush) Soul for sale

(Hush) Soul for sale (hush)

Don't make a sound (Don't make a sound)
(Don't make a sound)
Don't make a sound (Don't make a sound)
(Don't make a sound)

Soul for sale (hush)

There's snakes in the garden (Soul for sale)
Blood on the vines
(Hush, hush)
I can't wait anymore
I can't wait anymore
