There's danger on the way
But you won't need to pray
There's just another life to save
A daring crime so bold
To steal a nation's gold
The force is launched to catch them cold

Thunderbirds are go!
Calling, International Rescue
Calling, International Rescue
Calling, International Rescue...

They're off the beaten track
Preparing for attack
Blinding flashes, don't look back...
The clock is ticking down
Save them, save them, 'fore they drown

Thunderbirds are go!
Calling, International Rescue
Calling, International Rescue
Calling, International Rescue...

F.A.B. you're coming through
They need your help, no one else can do
Taken, gagged and tied
Who's captured them and why?
Send a message through the sky
(Help, help, can anybody hear me?)

Thunderbirds are go!
Calling, International Rescue
Calling, International Rescue
Calling, International Rescue...

Calling, International Rescue
Calling, International Rescue
Calling, International Rescue...

5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Zero!
