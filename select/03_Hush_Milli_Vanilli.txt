Hush Sweet Lover
Hush sweet lover, hush
And gently hold me in your trust
Lay down your walls
Let me love you with lust

Hush sweet lover, hush
And gently fold me in your touch
I beg of you hush, lover hush

Fall sweet lover, fall
Fall, giving me all
All you can give
Lover please give me all

Hush sweet lover, hush
And gently sway this waking crush
Soothe my desire
And my wanting you so

Hush sweet lover, hush
And gently stay within our trust
I beg of you hush, lover hush

I'm willing to fall
I'll give you my all
All I can give
I'll give my all

Hush sweet lover, hush
And gently fold me in your touch
I beg of you hush, lover hush
I beg of you hush, lover hush
I'm begging you hush, lover hush
